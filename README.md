## Project Title:
Tinkercad Thermometer

## Project Description:
This project simulates a digital thermometer using Tinkercad. It uses a temperature sensor (e.g., LM35 or DHT11/DHT22) to read the ambient temperature and displays the readings on an LCD. The circuit is built and tested in Tinkercad with Arduino programming.

## Components used:

- Arduino Uno

- Temperature Sensor (LM35 / DHT11 / DHT22)

- Breadboard

- Jumper Wires

## Circuit Diagram:
The thermometer circuit is built on a breadboard and connected to an Arduino Uno. It uses a TMP36 temperature sensor.

Connections:

- TMP36 Temperature Sensor:

- VCC (left pin) → Arduino 5V

- GND (right pin) → Arduino GND

- VOUT (middle pin) → Arduino Analog Pin A0

## Power Supply:
Arduino is powered via USB.

## What I Learned:
Basic Electronics Concepts - Understanding sensors (LM35/DHT11), wiring, resistors, and breadboards.
Arduino Programming - Reading sensor data, converting it to temperature values, and using libraries.
Simulation Skills: Testing and debugging circuits virtually in Tinkercad before physical implementation.
Problem Solving: Identifying and fixing wiring or code issues effectively.
